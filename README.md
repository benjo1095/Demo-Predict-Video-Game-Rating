# Demo-Predict-Video-Game-Rating

This is a VERY quick demonstration of loading in data and insepcting data, a few EDA tasks, then trying a machine learning model to predict results. Used for a demonstration for the Georgetown Certificate in Data Science Cohort 29 in May 2023.

The data used for the demo is "Video Game Ratings" by the ESRB it can be downloaded via Kaggle at the link below. The data set is a series of games and whether they have certain explicit content or not (0 or 1). The label we attempt to predict is the video game rating.
<u>Video Game Ratings:</u>

- E : Everyone
- E10 : Everyone 10+
- T : Teen
- M : Mature

The quick model test will be for multi-class classification and will attempt to predict the videogame rating.
